 	Intro: 
		List commits that are reachable by following the parent links from the given commit(s), 
		but exclude commits that are reachable from the one(s) given with a ^ in front of them. 
		The output is given in reverse chronological order by default.

		You can think of this as a set operation. Commits reachable from any of the commits given on the command line form a set, 
		and then commits reachable from any of the ones given with in front are subtracted from that set. 
		The remaining commits are what comes out in the commandâ€™s output. 
		Various other options and paths parameters can be used to further limit the result.
